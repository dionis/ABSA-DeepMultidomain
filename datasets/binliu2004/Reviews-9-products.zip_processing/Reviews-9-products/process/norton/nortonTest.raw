The next problem was that it did n't recognize all the installed $T$ , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .

If you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or Nortron Antivirus , the $T$ will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly .

Our $T$ Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so I 'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now , it should remain ok .
