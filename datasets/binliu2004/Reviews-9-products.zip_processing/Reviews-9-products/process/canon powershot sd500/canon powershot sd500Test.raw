If you on the other hand always use $T$ settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings I have ever seen .

I found best results in most situation with manual/center auto $T$ , manual mode , ISO 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with ISO 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras I have and they already do very-well ) .

As any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had somone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear $T$ apeared on the decently sized screen .

you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight $T$ shake is a problem to contend with .

The $T$ manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep .

The SD500 rivals the Canon G6 in $T$ quality .

digital $T$ is clear too ... say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then ... just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture

$T$ life is not long enough IF and ONLY IF you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times ... the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal .

The disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its $T$ on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can .

This is overall the best point and shoot $T$ I 've used .
