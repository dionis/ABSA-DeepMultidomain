another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap $T$ around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $ 500 price tag and get a quality camera .

A Digic II-powered $T$ system enables the SD500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip , its start-up time is tops in its class , and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition .

Could be better to be a perfect $T$ ( and some competitors do some of this better ) : purple fringing , details in high-light area , noise over ISO100 , red-eyes , ( few ) processing artefacts , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizing while video-playback , better video comression ( smaler viedo-files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the LCD , less weight .

I have especially enjoyed the $T$ mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) .
