1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low $T$ speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .

This simple nuance was too much for $T$ , and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .

3- It is $T$ , if you keep the original configuration and progs ( why 'd u buy it then ? ! ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .

Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped $T$ you do n't and wo n't need ( if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .

It 's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the $T$ messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable .

The $T$ buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customisable as well .
