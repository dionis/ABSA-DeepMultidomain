The $T$ recorders good , but you ca n't record songs off the radio for ring tones .

You can turn this $T$ into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3-player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a GPS map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! ! ) and also you can carry it in your pocket : ) .

It 's as though Nokia has segregated 90 % of the $T$ for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 % for the day to day use .

Despite a critical start , this $T$ deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) ... does more than most ... does it well ... is dependable .

When you $T$ a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct .

As the $T$ uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 .

You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with $T$ from linux ( KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this ) for sending files to the phone .

One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an $T$ connection for my laptop running linux , where softmodem drivers are hard to find , and do n't work very well .

The bottom line is `` $T$ is cool one - only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones '' .
