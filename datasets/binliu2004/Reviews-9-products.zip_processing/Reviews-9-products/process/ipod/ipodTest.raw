$T$ closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft , and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster 's services .

I was worried about what the $T$ quality would be like , but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound .

The $T$ wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers .

One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the $T$ in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved .

Overall the $T$ really is an almost flawless beast . The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and , for the price , I highly recommend it .

The $T$ issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement ' ) .

As with most $T$ that come with any type of music player , I recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears .

The iPod comes formatted for the Mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a PC , is automatically $T$ for Windows . ( The HP version comes with Windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to Mac . ) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .

These issues aside , the $T$ is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you ca n't be without one .

DURABILITY : Not good . First problem , if you have n't seen the news recently , the iPods are being recalled for $T$ problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months .
