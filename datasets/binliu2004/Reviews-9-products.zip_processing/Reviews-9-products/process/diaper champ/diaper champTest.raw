It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby $T$ go !

I got the $T$ champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags .

It is much easier to $T$ and unload than the Diaper Genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store ?

For my first I had a $T$ genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky .

The $T$ Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle .

It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with $T$ at all ( and we live in the damp and humid South , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ) .

We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty $T$ and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only .

The bags attach inside the $T$ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle .

But from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so I think this is kind of helpful- it 's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon $T$ .

Whether you are using disposable or cloth $T$ , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get !

Excellent diaper disposal $T$ .

The $T$ to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers ( I have a 3 month old ) and they 're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are .

But now that she is eating solids the $T$ is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner .

We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $ 6.00 and they $T$ great .
