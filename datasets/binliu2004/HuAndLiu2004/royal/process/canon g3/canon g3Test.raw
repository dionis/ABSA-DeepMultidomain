you can move the $T$ range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .

the lens is visible in the $T$ when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .

the only drawback is the $T$ is slightly blocked by the lens .

canon 's $T$ are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .

one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the $T$ , but does not detract from the image at all .

the reason i rated it a four is because of that $T$ diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )

with a quick spin of the $T$ you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .

i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would $T$ more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .

one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb $T$ card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .

the larger $T$ of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .

the canon g3 gives tons of $T$ for photo buffs but still has an `` auto `` mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .

i needed three $T$ to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :

when you look through the $T$ ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .

however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this $T$ is an excellent choice .

the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .

this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .

what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme $T$ of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
