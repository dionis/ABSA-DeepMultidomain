recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that $T$ of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .

the small $T$ is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
