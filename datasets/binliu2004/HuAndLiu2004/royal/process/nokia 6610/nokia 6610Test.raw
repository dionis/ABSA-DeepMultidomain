the phone comes with okay $T$ , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .

unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer $T$ dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .

the $T$ speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .

but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have $T$ dialing .

the phone 's $T$ quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .

from the $T$ that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .

the keys are close together , and the $T$ is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .

you can do * so * much more with the $T$ suite , i.e . free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .

finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for $T$ as a carrier .
