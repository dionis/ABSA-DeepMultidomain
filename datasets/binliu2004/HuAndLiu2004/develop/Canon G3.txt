[t]excellent picture quality / color 
canon powershot g3[+3]##i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . 
use[+2]##the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . 
##after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us . 
##i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way . 
picture[+2]##they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
picture quality[+1]##a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
picture quality[+1]##i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
##ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras . 
camera[+2], use[+2], feature[+1]##bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
quality picture[+3], use[+1], option[+1]##i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
##great job canon ! 
[t]cool toy
##yep . 
camera[+2]##this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! 
##i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it . 
picture[+2]##just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . 
use[+1]##whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together . 
##+ you can have different kind of lens if you want + flashes , etc. 
##as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) . 
##i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast . 
##a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images . 
##some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ). 
dial[-1]##* main dial is not backlit . 
viewfinder[-2]##* lens visible in optical viewfinder . 
##( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too . 
camera[+2][p]##overall i 'm happy with my toy . 
[t]canon g3 ? incredible camera 
##i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras . 
##a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models . 
##following my research , i decided on the g3 . 
camera[+3]##in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 
speed[+2],picture quality[+2],function[+2]##i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . 
auto setting[+2]##with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet . 
##and with the panoramic " stitch " mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image . 
camera[+3]##i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 . 
##do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed . 
[t]great camera 
canon g3[+3]##i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
photo quality[+2]##i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
feature[+2]##the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 
##flaws ? 
viewfinder[-1]##the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . 
##still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera . 
camera[+2]##despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography . 
[t]have n't had practice but i 'm already in love with it 
camera[+2]##i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
photo quality[+3]##the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . 
##i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) . 
##i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera . 
darn diopter adjustment dial[-1]##the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) 
##i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review . 
[t]excellent for the semi-serious amateur 
##positives 
exposure control[+2],auto setting[+2]##1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . 
metering option[+2]##excellent range of metering options as well . 
spot metering[+1]##it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
4mp[+1]##2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 
zoom[+1]##3 ) 4x zoom is nice 
##4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed . 
focus[+2]##5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . 
focus[+2]##you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . 
##negatives 
size[-2][u],weight[-2][u]##1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
design[-2][u]##2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
viewfinder[-2]##4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
[t]fantastic digital camera 
feature[+2], ##the camera has a wonderful set of features . 
lcd[+2]##the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures . 
##you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd . 
optical zoom[+2],digital zoom[+1]##the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry . 
picture[+3]##the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 
picture[+3]##i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . 
software[+2]##the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . 
lens cap[-1],viewfinder[-1]##the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
menu[+1],button[+1]##the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 
camera[+3]##it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 
[t]the best of everything 
camera[+3]##recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
control[+2]##advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . 
auto setting[+2]##newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 
photo quality[+3]##4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . 
##do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype . 
##unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it . 
use[+2][u]##those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use . 
##anyone looking for more than " point and shoot " can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference . 
zoom[+2],lense[+2]##the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class . 
##i expect the g3 will please me for years to come . 
[t]pure class & quality - a work of craftmanship 
camera[+3]##i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
picture[+3], control[+2], battery[+2], software[+2]##it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . 
quality of photos[+2], auto mode[+2]##i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
##absolutely breathtaking . 
##i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out . 
##the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 . 
##i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb . 
##i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon . 
[t]great camera 
##what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ? 
##i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally . 
##at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons . 
##i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife . 
##i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it ! 
canera[+2]##this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . 
print[+2]##the prints are beautiful ! 
##and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality . 
##i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected . 
battery[+1]##although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . 
[t]if you love an slr 35mm but need to go digital 
camera[+2]##this is a great camera for you ! 
control[+2],auto mode[+2]##the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . 
##i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos ! 
control[+2]##i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus . 
photo[+3]##i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers . 
##warning - i did read the manual ! 
control[+2]##but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! 
##once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located . 
dial[+1]##with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . 
manual mode[+2]##the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 
##it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them ! 
feel[+2],weight[+2]##this camera also has a great feel and weight to it . 
feel[+2]##you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy . 
camera[+2][p]##the more i work with it , the more i love it ! 
##i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow ! 
camera[+3][u]##i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 
[t]outstanding camera 
camera[+3]##this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . 
##i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge . 
camera[+2][u]##seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . 
picture[+2], auto mode[+2]##but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! 
four megapixel[+1]##four megapixels is great . 
##i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me . 
##if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download . 
##if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for . 
##if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it . 
product[+3][u]##it is a very amazing product . 
camera[+3][p]##i highly recommend it . 
[t]love my new g 3 
feature[+2]##just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . 
photo[+2]##takes excellent photos . 
night mode[+2]##night mode is clear as day . 
use[+1][u]##i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . 
viewfinder[-1]##the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . 
##however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem . 
camera[+3]##overall it is the best camera on the market . 
##i give it 10 stars ! 
[t]noise level 
##this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 . 
[t]the pictures are brillient 
##i just bought the camera a few days ago . 
##before i " get used to it " , here are my first feelings : 
picture quality[+3]##a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) ) 
lens cover[-2]##b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . 
##i wish canon would work out some way for that issue . 
zooming lever[-2]##the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . 
[t]great gadget 
##i bought this last week through amazon . 
##got a great deal from a reputable seller . 
camera[+2]##i love this camera . 
##i am still trying to figure out the may options it has . 
picture[+2]##took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 
color[+2],picture[+2],white balance[+2]##great colors , pictures and white balance . 
optical zoom[+1]##has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range . 
##it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for . 
[t]ok for a digital camera 
picture[-3][u]##maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . 
price[-3][u]##it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
camera[-2][u]##sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . 
##i do n't think i was asking too much . 
##any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort . 
##and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera . 
camera[-3]##i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . 
##i wanted it to shoot concerts as well . 
##that meant even less light and just as much action . 
##sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 . 
grain[-3]##the grain was terrible . 
##next time i set it at 100 and used the flash . 
flash photo[-3],noise[-2]##well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . 
photo[+3]##when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . 
camera[+1]##the camera was a marvel . 
##getting the printer to help output them was another tale . 
##overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do . 
##for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital . 
##you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost . 
##then again a one time use camera may do just as well . 
##if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera . 
camera[+3][p]##it is versatile and seems to be one of the best . 
##me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) . 
##sure . 
##it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output . 
[t]within its limitations 
##i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias . 
##i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move . 
##what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses . 
##i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient . 
##hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations . 
g3[+1]##i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . 
lag time[-2],flash[-2]##the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . 
##as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr . 
##at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available . 
depth[+1]##what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . 
##once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus . 
##now what about the flash problem ? 
flash[-2]##relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . 
external flash[+1]##fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
##i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 . 
##for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c . 
##in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself . 
flash[+2]##contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . 
##you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow . 
##then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored . 
##the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself . 
##this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away . 
##unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved . 
##the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) . 
##but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera . 
##the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you . 
##the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine . 
software[-2]##now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! 
software[-2]##the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . 
##i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information . 
##maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces . 
##i didnt wait to experiment . 
##instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in . 
g3[+3]##what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . 
color[+3]##without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! 
g3[+3],software[-2]##the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . 
software[-2]##what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . 
##what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it . 
image[+3]##but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
raw image[+3]##i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits . 
[t]knock your socks off great 
camera[+2][p]##i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . 
camera[+3]##this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . 
##my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time . 
battery life[+1]##battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves . 
##whoa . 
manual function[+2],picture quality[+3]##manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . 
##i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck . 
viewfinder[-1],lcd[+2],camera[+3]##not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . 
##if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there . 
##or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it . 
[t]great digital camera 
##after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews . 
##the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try . 
##i 'm very glad i did . 
service[+3]##the service from the supplier was exceptional . 
##the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition . 
photo[+3]##having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . 
##recently , i attended a " flyball " competition 
##-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles . 
photo[+3]##by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . 
automode[+2],manual mode[+2]##the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . 
##in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom . 
viewfinder[-2]##about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . 
##this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler . 
##but who cares ? 
##i always shoot using the lcd panel . 
camera[+3]##i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! 
[t]canon never ceases to amaze 
##being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 . 
canon[+3]##but canon never fails to amaze . 
##some of the great gains over g2 -- 
raw format[+2]##1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 
battery life[+1]##2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . 
software[+2]##3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 
##looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive . 
shape[+1]##4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . 
##a big plus in my book . 
##5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments . 
light[+2]##the light auto-correction is awesome .
picture[+2]##you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . 
##6 . the g2 's " color effect " exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable " effect func " menu option available in all exposure modes . 
##there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation . 
##7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view . 
##i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera . 
##( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ). 
white offset[+2]##8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . 
##in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking . 
##9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep . 
##personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors . 
g3[+3]##overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . 
##there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize . 
##short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
camera[+3][p]##this is quite simply the best you can ask for . 
[t]love the g2 
##i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade . 
##big mistake . 
low light[-2]##the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
picture[-3]##got way too many blurry pictures . 
##i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 ! 
[t]awesome pro-sumer camera 
##when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 . 
##yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power . 
##not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well . 
##her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use . 
##the nikon 's are great cameras . 
##+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures . 
##- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format . 
##olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body . 
##+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use . 
##- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull . 
##photos had some artifacts and noise . 
##my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands . 
##we also looked at the fuji fps602 . 
##nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again . 
##fiance did n't like the feel . 
##the canon g3 . 
photo[+3], use[+3], software[+2]##4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) 
##a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more . 
##the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own . 
##i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will . 
##always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do ! 
[t]upgraded from g2 and not looking back 
camera[+2]##the powershot g3 is a great camera . 
##why ? 
photo[+3]##because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 
camera[+2]##4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . 
feature[+1]##it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . 
##make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time ! 
[t]the catch 
unresponsiveness[-2]##the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . 
##prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture . 
##no one told me , but i wanted to tell you . 
##this is not the same thing as a film camera . 
##and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs . 
##they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet . 
##most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera . 
##but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw : 
delay[-1][u]##it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . 
##i am not talking milliseconds . 
##picture this : 
##your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment . 
##when it arrives , you press the shutter release . 
##splash ! 
##the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot . 
##perhaps there is a way around this delay . 
##some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get . 
##yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay . 
##yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash . 
##but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera . 
##i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera . 
##it focuses in a snap . 
##dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board . 
delay[-2][u]##canon 's g3 does it consistently . 
focus[-2], shoot[-2]##it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . 
##i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive . 
##and so i must ask , what are cameras for ? 
##what task do they perform ? 
##cameras capture moments . 
##they stop time . 
##because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back . 
##the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras . 
##a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture . 
##not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem . 
##like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone . 
##so buy the g3 . 
##buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever . 
##but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose . 
##from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to . 
g3[-2]##unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . 
[t]100 % happy 
camera[+3]##this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . 
##i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it . 
quality[+2]##i love the quality of the pictures .
picture quality[+2][p]##they look fantastic . 
##i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens . 
##it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments . 
[t]the best 4mp out there 
4mp camera[+2]##the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . 
##i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital . 
picture[+2]##with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots . 
control[+2],menu[+2]##i love the eos based controls and easy menus . 
##i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera . 
##many before me have done that already . 
##i agree with the positive reviews . 
##but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews . 
lens cap[-2]##1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . 
##though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display " lens " when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself . 
##i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens . 
##very cheaply made . 
body[-2]##2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . 
##the g2 was better in this respect . 
casing[-2]##it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . 
##despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera . 
[t]love it more and more
